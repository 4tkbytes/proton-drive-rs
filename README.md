# proton-sdk-rs
Yes, its a long name but I am yet to find a better one. 

Taken from [https://github.com/ProtonDriveApps/sdk](https://github.com/ProtonDriveApps/sdk), this project aims to create safe bindings to create Proton Drive apps with its sdk with a great language. 

For now, it is a work in progress, so contributions are as always welcome and appreciated. 

There is only one crate that exists, just to reserve the name until this project is completed (which is proton-sdk-rs). It doesn't have any functionality.
