# proton-drive-sdk-rs
Yes, its a long name but I am yet to find a better one. 

Taken from [https://github.com/ProtonDriveApps/sdk](https://github.com/ProtonDriveApps/sdk), this project aims to create safe bindings to create Proton Drive apps with its sdk with a great language. 

For now, it is a work in progress, so contributions are as always welcome and appreciated.
