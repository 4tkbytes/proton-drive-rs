# Sourcing the library

Hi there. You might be redirected to this message in the case that you have an issue
with your cargo build of the proton-sdk-sys library (most likely) or the dll has an issue. This is due to the
native proton-sdk libraries being dynamic.

This guide should help you to fixing it and getting your program up and running.

## Prebuilt

There are prebuilt libraries that already exist, as in the [releases page](https://github.com/4tkbytes/proton-sdk-rs/releases).
Download that, extract. Then do the following depending on what your situation is:

<details>
    <summary> Release </summary>
    This section is assuming that you downloaded proton-drive from github releases.

    Download the necessary dll for your platform (like linux for linux).
